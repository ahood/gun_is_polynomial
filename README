The "gun" problem from the NLEVP collection 
(http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/our-research/research-groups/numerical-analysis-and-scientific-computing/numerical-analysis/software/nlevp/)
can be converted to a polynomial eigenvalue problem by a change of variable. 
See Appendix B in thesis.pdf for details. The eigenvalue computation
is coded in gun.m.

NOTES:
- You will need the NLEVP toolbox installed and on your Matlab path.
